Description: The MAR1 package provides basic tools for preparing
        ecological community time-series data for MAR modeling,
        building MAR-1 models via model selection and bootstrapping,
        and visualizing and exporting model results. It is intended to
        make MAR analysis (sensu Ives et al. (2003) Analysis of
        community stability and ecological interactions from
        time-series data) a more accessible tool for anyone studying
        community dynamics.  The user need not necessarily be familiar
        with time-series modeling or command-based statistics programs
        such as R.
